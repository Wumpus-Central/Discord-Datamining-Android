# Discord Canary Mobile Client Data Mining Repository

Welcome to the Discord Canary Mobile Client Data Mining Repository, owned by the Wumpus Central organization. This repository is used to data mine the mobile Discord client in the canaryRelease version.

## What is Data Mining?

Data mining is the process of discovering resources, patterns in code, and their relationships in large data sets using analytical methods. In this case, we use data mining to extract information from the Discord mobile client that is not typically readily available to the average Discord app user.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following directories:

- `./assets/`: This directory contains assets such as app emotes, manifest, and other files that may not be important.
- `./res/`: This directory contains resources used in the data mining process, such as configuration files or reference data or even application graphic content (we are using xxhdpi assets).
- `./smali/`: This directory contains the decompiled source code from the DEX files.
